        review: `This Zenky T-shirt is very light, fairly in summer to wear that will be awesome for the sports or casual . The fabric is very soft as it is pure cotton . It’s nice and snuggly! I can’t wait for it to get cool enough to wear it!`,

        review: `Excellent shirt! Very comfortable and it has a soft lining which keeps you cool. Great shirt, i wear it almost daily. It’s not water-proof so keep that in mind when outside. Also, get 1 size bigger so when it shrinks, it’ll still fit.`,
